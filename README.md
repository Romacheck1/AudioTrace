Hello! This project / Web Service is dedicated to every incomplete full-stack web service in the process of teaching myself how to code
SoundTrace is a web service that tracks various forms of audio like Songs / Podcasts / Streams / Audio Books all in one spot
Version 0.1 Simply contains a header, a footer, and the boxes of future content areas
What makes this project the grand culmination of all my test learning services is that I am now confident in my ability -
to develop a PROFESSIONAL web service that contains the same structure of real life code - for example I have greatly
imporved on my understanding of core concepts like responsivness and flexibility. On top of that I have learned
to store my code in a clearer structure and to document for improved readability.
So far these are the used technologies for this webservice:
Basic Front End Combination -
1.CSS Tailwind
2.JavaScirpt
3.TypeScript
Dev Ops -
