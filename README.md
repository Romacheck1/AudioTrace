Hello! This project / Web Service is dedicated to every incomplete full-stack web service in the process of teaching myself how to code.

## About This Project

What makes this project the grand culmination of all my test learning services is that I am now confident in my ability - to develop a PROFESSIONAL web service that contains the same structure of real life code - for example I have greatly improved on my understanding of core concepts like responsivness and flexibility. On top of that I have learned to store my code in a clearer structure and to document for improved readability.
